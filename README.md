This is our IS1200 Mini Project: a tilting maze game which simulates the handheld ball mazes you often find as prizes at carnivals, etc.

As part of this project we have implemented automatic maze generation, and a rudimentary library/header for the LSM6DSO accelerometer/gyroscope sensor.

In addition, we've written a basic graphics library for the Soloman Systech SSD1306 display controller, which powers the 128x32 OLED display on the ChipKIT Basic I/O Shield.
